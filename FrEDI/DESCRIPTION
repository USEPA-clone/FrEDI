Description: This R package models damages and impacts from climate change in the contiguous United States (CONUS) 
    using the Framework for Evaluating Damages and Impacts (FrEDI) developed as part of the Climate Change Impacts and 
    Risk Analysis (CIRA) project at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The package contains functions that 
    implement FrEDI for projecting impacts from climate change and sea level rise for a selected set of 
    sectors. Version 3 and above includes a module for estimating impacts on socially vulnerable populations for 
    select sectors. Version 3.3.0 extends calculations out to 2300 to facilitate the calculation of Net Present Damages 
    (NPD) but only contains default values through 2090--users must provide their own inputs through 2300.
